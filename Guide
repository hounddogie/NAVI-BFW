The BFW-v5 variant and what is different about it:

BFW-v5 is a mech chip that adds interesting aspects of control to a prop mech.
Most things will use mouse control for the head (torso) or the A and D key to turn.
BFW takes a different approach, BFW locks your camera and uses your mouse control to turn the whole mech.
this also give the mech the ability to strafe with wsad since your mouse handles steering and looking
This means the input for BFW doesnt take your player's eye angles, aimposition, or direct key input. 
Instead, an eyepod is connected to it and it feeds data off your mouse movements.
Eyepods lock your view and then addor subtract to an X and Y number ex: mouse move left> eyepod subtracts X output
so instead of a vector, angle, or boolean input, bfw takes an X and Y that can go from -100000 and 1000000 and so on
it takes that raw X and Y input and does some division and translates the values to angles for the hip (X) and angles for the torso (Y)
Nav-BFW uses bearing and such to make the mech aim by incrementing and decrementing the X and Y just like the eye pod.

Requirements for use:
Anything that accepts WSAD control and has inputs for them (Yes NAVI BFW still does output bassic wsad and 0-1 turning)
Navi chip
A target



to use navi, you must wire the outputs to a BFW mech's chip
x to x
y to y
aimpos must have a coordinate (where the mech will walk to)
Target must have a boolean value of 1 to activate NAVI
W must goto Forward (W can be made negative and will act as both forwards and backwards)
m1m2m3 can go to rocket pods, they sequence their firing
reload is to reload rocket pods
You will also need to feed a target entity to Target[entity] using a target finder
